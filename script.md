Seeing Upside-Down: a brief taste of algebraic geometry

[clear]

VO: Let's talk about rings.

VO: A ring is a set that knows how to add, subtract, and multiply.
    Soem basic examples are: the integers, the integers modulo some n, the rationals, the real numbers, the complex numbers.

[Show each of these in sequence: \Z, \Z/\Z n, \Q, \R, \C]

VO: But here's another example that we're going to take a closer look at:
    any ring with some *variables* adjoined to it is also a ring.

[Show \R[x,y]]
