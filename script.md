Seeing Upside-Down: a brief taste of algebraic geometry

[clear]

VO: Let's talk about real polynomial rings.

[Show something like $\R[t] \qquad \R[x,y] \qquad \R[u,v,w] \qquad \cdots$ ]

VO: The elements of one of these rings are all the polynomials we can write down over a particular set of variables,
with real coeffients.

[Show a bunch of example polynomials underneath each of these rings]

VO: What are the nice functions between these rings? Let's consider an example.

[Show $f : \R[x,y] \to \R[t]$ ]

What are some nice functions from R[x,y] to R[t]? Let's say that we want to only map constants
to themselves.

[show f(0) = 0 and f(-3) = -3 and f(100/7) = 100/7]

If f is a ring homomorphism, then the only freedom we have left is deciding what x and y
get mapped to. What happens to a polynomial in R[x,y] is completely determined by constants
and x and y. In other words, a nice function from R[x,y] to R[t] amounts to making
only two choices: choosing a polynomial in t to map x to, and another polynomial in t to map y to.

[animate cycling through various examples of these... like hold on
x \mapsto t^3 + 1
y \mapsto t^2 - t
and then transition to
x \mapsto t
y \mapsto t^5 - t^4 + t^3 - t^2 + 3
etc.
