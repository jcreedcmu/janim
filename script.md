Seeing Upside-Down: a brief taste of algebraic geometry

[clear]

VO: Let's talk about rings.

VO: A ring is a set that knows how to add, subtract, and multiply.
    Soem basic examples are: the integers, the integers modulo some n, the rationals, the real numbers, the complex numbers.

[Show each of these in sequence: \Z, \Z/\Z n, \Q, \R, \C]

VO: Here's another example: any ring with some *variables* adjoined to it is also a ring.

[Show \R[x,y]]

VO: The elements of this ring are all the possible expressions we could write down
nvolving the real numbers, and variables x and y,

[Show a bunch of example real numbers 0, 1, -2, 100/3, 9.5, \pi, sqrt{2}, and variables x and y in a sort of chaotic soup]

VO: built up with ring operations --- addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

[Show some new expressions like 8, 3+5, 2 * \pi, \pi * 2, y + x * x * x, x^3 + y, x * y, y * x]

We consider two expressions the same if the ring axioms force them to be the same.

[animate unifying 8 with 3 + 5,
2 * \pi with \pi * 2,
y + x * x * x with  x^3 + y,
x * y with y * x]

VO: The elements of this ring are exactly the *polynomials* over x and y, with real number coefficients.
