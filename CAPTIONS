[!Title]

[!Rings]
Let's talk about real polynomial rings.

[!Labels]
The elements of a polynomial ring
are all the polynomials we can write down

[!Polys]
over a particular set of variables,
with real coefficients.

[!Hom]

[!TypeSig]
What are the nice functions
from R[x,y] to R[t]?

[!Constants]
A nice function maps constants to themselves
and is a ring homomorphism.

[!RingOps]
It respects all the ring operations.

[!Mappings]
The only freedom left is deciding
what x and y map to — two choices.

[!Param2D]

[!Plot2D]
This is the same thing as describing
a parameterized curve in the plane.

[!Param3D]

[!Plot3D]
If we had three variables instead,
we'd get parameterized curves in 3D space.

[!Duality]
Maps from R[x,y] to R[t] give curves in the plane,
and maps from R[x,y,z] to R[t] give curves in 3D.

[!Row2]
Try changing the number of variables
on both sides and see what happens.

[!Row3]
Maps from R[x,y] to just R
are mere points in the plane.

[!Row4]
Maps from R[x,y,z] to R[t,u] are
polynomial surfaces in 3D space.

[!Row5]
There's a general pattern happening here.

[!Uniform]
Nice maps from n variables to p variables
correspond to geometric maps from R^p to R^n.

[!Closing]
The duality between algebra and geometry.
