[!BEGIN] [!Title] [!Rings]
Let's talk about real polynomial rings. [!Labels]

The elements of a polynomial ring are all the polynomials we can write
down [!Polys] over a particular set of variables, with real
coefficients.

We could ask: what are some nice functions
between polynomial rings?

[!Hom]
For example,
[!TypeSig]
What are nice functions from R[x,y] to R[t]?

Well... I haven't said what "nice" means. Let's make some decisions about that.

We'll say a nice function f needs to map constants [!Constants] to themselves,
and also needs to be a ring homomorphism. That is, it preserves [!RingOps]
all ring operations, addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

Given those constraints, our function is completely determined by
what it does to x and y: f(x) is some polynomial [!Mappings]
in t, and so is f(y).

and another way of looking at this is that our
function is a description of
a parameterized [!Param2D]
[!Plot2D]
curve in the plane.

If we had three variables instead,
we'd get parameterized curves in 3D space.

[!Param3D]

[!Plot3D]

So, we've seen that [!Duality] maps from R[x,y] to R[t] are  curves in the plane,
and [!Row2] maps from R[x,y,z] to R[t] give curves in 3D space.


We can play around more with the the number of variables
on both sides and see what happens.


[!Row3] Maps from  R[x,y] to just R
are mere points in the plane, because we can only assign constants to x and y.

[!Row4]
Maps from R[x,y,z] to R[t,u] are
polynomial surfaces in 3D space, because for each of x, y, and z, we give a polynomial
for how those coordinates vary with the two "time coordinates" t and u.

If we [!Uniform] write these facts in a more uniform way, it's easier to
see what the pattern is.

[!Row5]
Nice maps from n variables to p variables
correspond to geometric maps from R^p to R^n.
