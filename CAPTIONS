[!BEGIN] [!Title] [!Rings]
Let's talk about real polynomial rings. [!Labels]

The elements of a polynomial ring are all the polynomials we can write
down [!Polys] over a particular set of variables, with real
coefficients.

We could ask: what are some nice functions
between polynomial rings?

[!Hom]
For example,
[!TypeSig]
What are nice functions from R[x,y] to R[t]?

Well... I haven't said what "nice" means. Let's make some decisions about that.

We'll say a nice function f needs to map constants [!Constants] to themselves,
and also needs to be a ring homomorphism. That is, it preserves [!RingOps]
all ring operations, addition, subtraction, and multiplication.

Given those constraints, our function is completely determined by
what it does to x and y: f(x) is some polynomial [!Mappings]
in t, and so is f(y).

and another way of looking at this is that our
function is a description of
a parameterized [!Param2D]
curve in the plane.

The polynomials in t that f assigns to x and y say how to compute the x and y coordinates as a function of time.
[!Param3D]
And if instead we had asked about
[!Plot3D]
nice functions from R[x,y,z] to R[t],
we'd find they correspond to parameterized curves in 3D space.

So, we've seen that [!Duality] maps from R[x,y] to R[t] are curves in the plane,
and [!Row2] maps from R[x,y,z] to R[t] give curves in 3D space.

We can play around more with the the number of variables
on both sides and see what happens.

[!Row3] Maps from  R[x,y] to just R
are mere points in the plane, because we can only assign constants to x and y.

[!Row4]
Maps from R[x,y,z] to R[t,u] are
polynomial surfaces in 3D space, because for each of x, y, and z, we give a polynomial
for how those coordinates vary with the two "time coordinates" t and u.

If we [!Uniform] write these facts in a more uniform way, it's easier to
see what the pattern is.

[!Row5]
Nice algebraic maps from a ring with n variables to a ring with p
variables correspond to geometric maps in the *other
direction*, from p-dimensional space to n-dimensional space.

So it's very tempting to say that R[x,y] "is" a two dimensional
"space", and R[x,y,z] "is" a three-dimensional space and so on... except
"backwards" or "upside down" in some sense, because the maps between
them get turned around.

[!Closing]
This is a taste of a really deep and interesting theme that's at the
heart of algebraic geometry, that algebra and geometry are in some
sense *dual* to one another. I hope to make a few more little videos
exploring this, stay tuned.
